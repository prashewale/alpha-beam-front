      "The IC-M400BBE 'modular' marine radio solution can be installed out of sight, which is important, where space is at a premium. Controlled by the Icom HM-195GB COMMANDMIC this allows operation of all radio functions including DSC, radio, foghorn, hailer horn from the cockpit or fly bridge. The HM-195GB COMMANDMIC utilises the same user soft key interface used on Icom’s latest range of marine radios making control of the radio very straight forward.",

Whether you’re navigating through crowded waterways or contending with poor visibility, HALO24 radar immediately cuts through the clutter to give you a clear and current picture of your surroundings. </p>\n<p>Compatible with<span> </span><a href="https://www.echomasterdirect.co.uk/Chartplotters/Multifunction_Displays&amp;min=&amp;max=&amp;filter=1" target="_blank">NSS EVO2, NSS EVO3, NSO EVO2 &amp; GO XSE MDF\'s</a></p>\n<p>Note: A<span> </span><a href="https://www.echomasterdirect.co.uk/GPS&amp;min=&amp;max=&amp;filter=1" target="_blank">Heading Sensor</a><span> </span>is required to support MARPA Tracking and Dual Guard zones.</p>\n<p><span style="color: #003163;"><span>Key Features</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>48nm range from a compact 24-inch dome</li>\n<li>Advanced pulse compression technology with beam sharpening</li>\n<li>Simultaneous Dual Range operation sees both near and far</li>\n<li>Ultra-fast 60 RPM operation at ranges up to 1.5nm</li>\n<li>VelocityTrack™ Doppler technology for collision avoidance</li>\n<li>Easy operation with harbour, offshore, weather, and bird modes</li>\n<li>MARPA target tracking (up to 10 targets, 20 in dual range)</li>\n<li>Ready instantly from standby</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style="color: #003163;"><span>In the Box</span></span></p>\n<p>HALO24 with 10m cable, RI12 interface box, ethernet adapter cable and waterproof boot</p>',

    shortDescription:
      'Perfect for a wide range of coastal bay boats, HALO24 comes in a compact dome antenna and delivers high-quality short, mid and long-range detection. Monitor two distance ranges at once in Dual Range mode which enables you to keep an eye on far away weather cells while watching for collision hazards up close. HALO24 radar’s pulse compression technology means no compromises in detection at either selected range, while beam sharpening provides enhanced separation between small or distant targets.',
